<h1 align="center">How Rsync Works<br>A Practical Overview</h1>
<h2 align="center">Foreword</h2>
<p>
The original
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/">Rsync technical report</a>
and
Andrew Tridgell's
<a href="http://samba.org/~tridge/phd_thesis.pdf">Phd thesis (pdf)</a>
Are both excellent documents for understanding the
theoretical mathematics and some of the mechanics of the rsync algorithm.
Unfortunately they are more about the theory than the
implementation of the rsync utility (hereafter referred to as
Rsync).
</p><p>
In this document I hope to describe...
</p><ul>
	<li>A non-mathematical overview of the rsync algorithm.
	</li><li>How that algorithm is implemented in the rsync utility.
	</li><li>The protocol, in general terms, used by the rsync utility.
	</li><li>The identifiable roles the rsync processes play.
</li></ul>
<p>
This document be able to serve as a guide for programmers
needing something of an entré into the source code but the
primary purpose is to give the reader a foundation from
which he may understand
</p><ul>
	<li>Why rsync behaves as it does.
	</li><li>The limitations of rsync.
	</li><li>Why a requested feature is unsuited to the code-base.
</li></ul>
<p>
This document describes in general terms the construction
and behaviour of Rsync.  In some cases details and exceptions
that would contribute to specific accuracy have
been sacrificed for the sake meeting the broader goals.
</p><h2 align="center">Processes and Roles</h2>
<p>
When we talk about Rsync we use specific terms to refer to
various processes and their roles in the task performed by
the utility.  For effective communication it is important that we
all be speaking the same language; likewise it is important
that we mean the same things when we use certain terms in a
given context.  On the rsync mailing list there is often
some confusion with regards to role and processes.  For
these reasons I will define a few terms
used in the role and process contexts that will be used henceforth.

<table cellspacing="20"><tbody><tr valign="top">
<td>client
</td><td>role
</td><td>
	The client initiates the synchronisation.
</td></tr><tr valign="top">

	The remote rsync process or system to which the
	client connects either within a local transfer, via
	a remote shell or via a network socket.

</p><h2 align="center">Process Startup</h2>
<p>
When an Rsync client is started it will first establish a
connection with a server process.  This connection may be
through pipes or over a network socket.
</p><p>
When Rsync communicates with a remote non-daemon server via
a remote shell the startup method is to fork the remote
shell which will start an Rsync server on the remote system.
Both the Rsync client and server are communicating via pipes
through the remote shell.  As far as the rsync processes are
concerned there is no network.
In this mode the rsync options for the server process are
passed on the command-line that is used to start the remote
shell.
</p><p>
When Rsync is communicating with a daemon it is
communicating directly with a network socket.  This is the
only sort of Rsync communication that could be called
network aware.
In this mode the rsync options must be sent over the socket, as
described below.
</p><p>
At the very start of the communication between the client
and the server, they each send the maximum protocol version
they support to the other side.
Each side then uses the minimum value as the the protocol
level for the transfer.
If this is a daemon-mode connection, rsync options are sent
from the client to the server.  Then, the exclude list is
transmitted.  From this point onward the
client-server relationship is relevant only with regards
to error and log message delivery.
</p><p>
Local Rsync jobs (when the source and destination are both on locally
mounted filesystems) are done exactly like a push.  The
client, which becomes the sender, forks a server process to
fulfill the receiver role.  The client/sender and
server/receiver communicate with each other over pipes.
</p><h2 align="center">The File List</h2>
The file list includes not only the pathnames but also
ownership, mode, permissions, size and modtime.
If the --checksum option has been specified it also includes
the file checksums.
<p>
The first thing that happens once the startup has completed
is that the sender will create the file list.
While it is being built, each entry is transmitted to the
receiving side in a network-optimised way.
</p><p>
When this is done, each side sorts the file list lexicographically by path
relative to the base directory of the transfer.
(The exact sorting algorithm varies depending on what protocol
version is in effect for the transfer.)
Once that has happened all references to files
will be done by their index in the file list.
</p><p>
If necessary the sender follows the file list with id&#8594;name
tables for users and groups which the receiver will use to
do a id&#8594;name&#8594;id translation for every file in the file
list.
</p><p>
After the file list has been received by the receiver, it
will fork to become the generator and receiver pair
completing the pipeline.
</p><h2 align="center">The Pipeline</h2>
Rsync is heavily pipelined.  This means that it is a set of
processes that communicate in a (largely) unidirectional
way.  Once the file list has been shared the pipeline
behaves like this:
<blockquote>
	generator &#8594; sender &#8594; receiver
</blockquote>
<p>
The output of the generator is input for the sender and the
output of the sender is input for the receiver.
Each process runs independently and is delayed only when the
pipelines stall or when waiting for disk I/O or CPU resources.
</p><h2 align="center">The Generator</h2>
<p>
The generator process compares the file list with its local
directory tree.  Prior to beginning its primary function, if
--delete has been specified, it will first identify local
files not on the sender and delete them on the receiver.
</p><p>
The generator will then start walking the file list.  Each
file will be checked to see if it can be skipped.  In the
most common mode of operation files are not skipped if the
modification time or size differs.  If --checksum was
specified a file-level checksum will be created and
compared.  Directories, device nodes and symlinks are not
skipped.  Missing directories will be created.  
</p><p>
If a file is not to be skipped, any existing version on the
receiving side becomes the "basis file" for the transfer, and is
used as a data source that will help to eliminate matching data
from having to be sent by the sender.  To effect this remote
matching of data, block checksums are created for the basis file
and sent to the sender immediately following the file's index
number.
An empty block checksum set is sent for new files and if
--whole-file was specified.
</p><p>
The block size and, in later versions, the size of the
block checksum are calculated on a per file basis according
to the size of that file.
</p><h2 align="center">The Sender</h2>
The sender process reads the file index numbers and associated
block checksum sets one at a time from the generator.
<p>
For each file id the generator sends it will store the
block checksums and build a hash index of them for rapid lookup.
</p><p>
Then the local file is read and a checksum is
generated for the block beginning with the first byte of the
local file.  This block checksum is looked for in the
set that was sent by the generator, and if no match is found,
the non-matching byte will be appended to the non-matching data
and the block starting at the next byte will be compared.
This is what
is referred to as the “rolling checksum”
</p><p>
If a block checksum match is found it is considered a
matching block and any accumulated non-matching data will be
sent to the receiver followed by the offset and length in
the receiver's file of the matching block and the block
checksum generator will be advanced to the next byte after
the matching block.
</p><p>
Matching blocks can be identified in this way even if
the blocks are reordered or at different offsets.  
This process is the very heart of the rsync algorithm.
</p><p>
In this way, the sender will give the receiver instructions for
how to reconstruct the source file into a new destination file.
These instructions detail all the matching data that can be
copied from the basis file (if one exists for the transfe),
and includes any raw data that was not available locally.
At the end of each file's processing a whole-file
checksum is sent and the sender proceeds with the next
file.
</p><p>
Generating the rolling checksums and searching for matches
in the checksum set sent by the generator require a good
deal of CPU power.  Of all the rsync processes it is the
sender that is the most CPU intensive.
</p><h2 align="center">The Receiver</h2>
<p>
The receiver will read from the sender data for each file
identified by the file index number.  It will open the local
file (called the basis) and will create a temporary file.
</p><p>
The receiver will expect to read non-matched data and/or to match
records all in sequence for the final file contents.  When
non-matched data is read it will be written to the
temp-file.  When a block match record is received the
receiver will seek to the block offset in the basis file
and copy the block to the temp-file.  In this way the
temp-file is built from beginning to end.
</p><p>
The file's checksum is generated as the temp-file is built.
At the end of the file, this checksum is compared with the
file checksum from the sender.  If the file checksums do not
match the temp-file is deleted.  If the file fails once it
will be reprocessed in a second phase, and if it fails twice
an error is reported.
</p><p>
After the temp-file has been completed, its ownership and
permissions and modification time are set.  It is then
renamed to replace the basis file.
</p><p>
Copying data from the basis file to the temp-file make the
receiver the most disk intensive of all the rsync processes.
Small files may still be in disk cache mitigating this but
for large files the cache may thrash as the generator has
moved on to other files and there is further latency caused
by the sender.  As
data is read possibly at random from one file and written to
another, if the working set is larger than the disk cache,
then what is called a seek storm can occur, further
hurting performance.
</p><h2 align="center">The Daemon</h2>
The daemon process, like many daemons, forks for every
connection.  On startup, it parses the rsyncd.conf file
to determine what modules exist and to set the global options.
<p>
When a connection is received for a defined module the
daemon forks a new child process to handle the connection.
That child process then reads the rsyncd.conf file to set
the options for the requested module, which may chroot to the
module path and may drop setuid and setgid for the
process.  After that it will behave just like any other
rsync server process adopting either a sender or receiver
role.
</p><h2 align="center">The Rsync Protocol</h2>
<p>
A well-designed communications protocol has a number of
characteristics.
</p><ul>
	<li>Everything is sent in well defined packets with
		a header and an optional body or data payload.
	</li><li>In each packet's header a type and or command
		specified.
	</li><li>Each packet has a definite length.
</li></ul>
<p>
In addition to these characteristics, protocols have varying degrees of
statefulness, inter-packet independence, human readability,
and the ability to reestablish a disconnected session.
</p><p>
Rsync's protocol has none of these good characteristics.  The data is
transferred as an unbroken stream of bytes.  With the
exception of the unmatched file-data, there are no length
specifiers nor counts.  Instead the meaning of each byte is
dependent on its context as defined by the protocol level.
</p><p>
As an example, when the sender is sending  the file list it
simply sends each file list entry and terminates the list
with a null byte.  Within the file list entries, a bitfield
indicates which fields of the structure to expect and those
that are variable length strings are simply null terminated.
The generator sending file numbers and block checksum sets
works the same way.
</p><p>
This method of communication works quite well on reliable
connections and it certainly has less data overhead than the
formal protocols.  It unfortunately makes the protocol
extremely difficult to document, debug or extend.
Each version of the protocol will have subtle differences on
the wire that can only be anticipated by knowing the exact
protocol version.
</p><h2 align="center">notes</h2>
This document is a work in progress.  The author expects
that it has some glaring oversights and some portions that may be
more confusing than enlightening for some readers.  It is
hoped that this could evolve into a useful reference.
<p>
Specific suggestions for improvement are welcome, as would be a
complete rewrite.
